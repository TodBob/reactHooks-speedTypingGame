This is preaty simple project for ReactHooks. It's initialized with npm react-create-app, nothing more added. So I decided just add App.js and App.css files. 

This project is builded primary with focus on Hooks

Css is here just for basic styling, to hold some form.

To run this game, just create new app with ,,npx create-react-app my-appp,, copy paste code from App.js/css.
